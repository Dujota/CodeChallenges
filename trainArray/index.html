  <h1>Train Schedule excercise</h1>

  <div>
    <p>
      Create the following array in your JS file:
    </p>

    <code style=display:block;white-space:pre-wrap>
        [
        {train: "72C", frequency_in_minutes: 15, direction: "north"},
        {train: "72D", frequency_in_minutes: 15, direction: "south"},
        {train: "610", frequency_in_minutes: 5, direction: "north"},
        {train: "611", frequency_in_minutes: 5, direction: "south"},
        {train: "80A", frequency_in_minutes: 30, direction: "east"},
        {train: "80B", frequency_in_minutes: 30, direction: "west"},
        {train: "110", frequency_in_minutes: 15, direction: "north"},
        {train: "111", frequency_in_minutes: 15, direction: "south"}
        ]
      </code>

    <ol>
      <li>Save the direction of train 111 into a variable.</li>
      <li>Save the frequency of train 80B into a variable.</li>
      <li>Save the direction of train 610 into a variable.</li>
      <li>Create an empty array. Iterate through each train and add the name of the train into the array if it travels north.</li>
      <li>Do the same thing for trains that travel east.</li>
      <li>You probably just ended up rewriting some of the same code. Move this repeated code into a method that accepts a direction
        and a list of trains as arguments, and returns a list of just the trains that go in that direction. Call this method
        once for north and once for east in order to DRY up your code.</li>
      <li>Pick one train and add another key/value pair for the first_departure_time. For simplicity, assume the first train
        always leave on the hour. You can represent this hour as an integer: 6 for 6:00am, 12 for noon, 13 for 1:00pm, etc.</li>
    </ol>
